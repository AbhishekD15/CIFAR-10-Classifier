# Image Classification with CIFAR-10 dataset

This repository contains implementation of different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) classifier.

[Shallow_Deep_Leaning](https://github.com/AbhishekD15/CIFAR-10-Classifier/blob/main/Shallow_Deep_Learning.ipynb) contains the notebook where we have built a shallow neuarl network and train the model to test it's performance. We added more layers to 
form a deeper network and observed an imporvemnet in performance. 

[Transfer_Learning](https://github.com/AbhishekD15/CIFAR-10-Classifier/blob/main/Transfer_Learning.ipynb) contains implemnetation of Transfer Learning concept on CIFAR-10 dataset using pre trained ResNet50. Here It uses pre trained ResNet50 for classifying cifar10 data set since 
ResNet50 is trained for 50 categories we will remove the last layer and we will add the last softmax layer to classify 10 categories of the cifar10 dataset.
